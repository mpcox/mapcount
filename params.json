{"name":"Mapcount","tagline":"Counts read hits against a reference gene set","body":"# mapcount\r\n\r\nThe Perl program **mapcount** counts next generation sequencing reads that map against a reference gene set.\r\n\r\n**mapcount** extracts a list of expected sequence IDs from a user-provided FASTA file (such as a file of gene models).  It then parses a user-provided mapping file in the standard SAM format and counts the number of reads that map to each gene.  Tabular output is written to a user-defined text file.\r\n\r\nOptional flags allow the user to:\r\n\r\n+ Trim the sequence ID before a space (*e.g.*, \"comp18530_c0_seq1 len=1406 path=[683:0-1405]\" would instead be represented as \"comp18530_c0_seq1\").\r\n+ Define the minimum match length to include the read (*e.g.*, all matching reads smaller than some specified value, such as 25 base pairs, can be excluded from the output table).\r\n+ Count paired end reads as only a single match. (Although there might be two paired reads, these represent only one single underlying nucleotide fragment).\r\n\r\n\r\nProgram usage is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmap_count -f|fasta FASTA file -s|sam SAM file -o|output text file \r\n         [-t|trim] [-l|length 25] [-p|pair]\r\n```\r\n```\r\nRequired flags:\r\n-f|fasta    FASTA reference file\r\n-s|sam      SAM mapping file\r\n-o|output   tabular text file\r\n```\r\n```\r\nOptional flags:\r\n-t|trim     trim ID to entry before first space\r\n-l|length   minimum match length for inclusion in the count table\r\n-p|pair     count paired matches as one match\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
